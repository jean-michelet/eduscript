# EduScript
EduScript is a statically-typed, object-oriented programming language written in TypeScript for educational purposes.

## Work In Progress
At present, the lexical analyzer (scanner) and syntaxic analyzer (parser) have been developed. The next steps are the semantic analyzer and an AST interpreter.

Edit 15/11/2023: As the semantic analyzer is very similar to the AST interpreter, I decided to develop a byte-code virtual machine.
